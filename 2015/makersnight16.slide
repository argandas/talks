* How does social networks apply to #3DPrinted things?

Social networks are all about sharing

* Consumer phase

You find something useful and start to play with it.

Free 3D models are available all over the web, so you can get blueprints to printout what you need (or didn't know you needed)

* Contributor phase

Then you find a show-stopping bug, or youâ€™d like to have a feature.

* Initiate

You create something and publish your blueprints (source code)

* My experience with #3DPrinted things + Social Networks

* As a consumer

I was looking a case for my old Xbox 360

* As a contributor

Once printed, it didn't fit very well on my new Xbox 360.

Unfortunately the source files were not available, only STL files.

* As a creator

So I decided to create my own version of the case, with enhanced measures and additional features.

And it fits great!

Also sharing feels wonderful, maybe this is useful to someone else.
