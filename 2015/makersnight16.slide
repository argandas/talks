* What is a social network?

* By defintion

A social network is a dedicated website or other application that enables users to communicate with each other by posting information, comments, messages, images, etc.

* Social networks are all about sharing

* Social networking stages

* Stage #1: Consumer

You find something useful and print it.

Free 3D models are available all over the web, so you can get blueprints to printout what you need (or didn't know you needed)

* Stage #2: Contributor

Then you find it has errors or see a chance for improvement

Or youâ€™d like to have a new feature.

* Stage #3: Creator

You create something and share your blueprints

Also you can sell your stuff

* Where can I found 3D Models to print?

* Social networks for 3D prints

Facts:

- 3D printers are going mainstream
- There is a lot of places where you can get/share 3D models
- Most popular networks are run by 3D printer companies

Notes:

- .STL is likely the default file format to share your designs

* Social networks run by a 3D printer company:

* My experience with #3DPrinted things

* As a consumer


I was looking a case for my old Xbox 360 HDD

* As a contributor

Once printed, it didn't fit very well on my new Xbox 360.

Unfortunately the source files were not available, only STL files.

* As a creator

I decided to create my own version, with enhanced measures and additional features.

And it fits great!

Also sharing feels wonderful, maybe this be useful to someone else.
